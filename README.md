##  Vipul H. Harihar GitHub Page : Glad to see you here :)


I am currently a graduate student at <b>Columbia University, New York,</b> pursuing Masters in Data Science at the <b> Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Sciences School.</b> My concrete fundamental skill involves:
<li> Problem-solving </li>
<li> Data Handling, Management and Modeling </li>
<li> Software engineering </li>
<li> Application and Web Development </li>
<li> User Experience and Design Enhancer </li>
<br>
Before pursuing my masters in 'Data Science', I worked as an Application Developer at IBM where I handled projects involving 'Data Collection', 'Cleaning', 'Storage', 'Management', 'Analytics', and 'Data Wrangling'. I honed my technical skills in Java, Python, R, SQL, Web Data Analysis, and IBM Cognos Analytics by working on 2 international projects and deploying one software application on Cloud, and devised machine learning models into production on Openshift Cloud Platform.
<br><br>
As a self-motivated, perseverant individual with industrial experience in Data Science and Computer Science, I would be able to bring a combination of skills that would help me perform greatly to achieve goals and enable companies to make insightful and effective decisions.
